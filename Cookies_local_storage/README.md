# Cookies & Local Storage

This project demonstrates how to:

- Set and read **cookies** with JavaScript
- Set cookie expiration and path
- Use `js-cookie` library for simplified cookie handling
- Use **localStorage** and **sessionStorage** for web persistence
- Build a basic and advanced cart system using web storage
